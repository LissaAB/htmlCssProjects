    <h1>Two Truths, One Lie</h1>
    <p>Here are some notes for the Two Truths, One Lie about me. Let's see if you can figure it out.</p>

    <h2>Atlas</h2>
    <p>My Great Great Uncle was Charles Atlas, an Italian-born American bodybuilder best remembered as the developer of a bodybuilding method and its associated exercise program which spawned a landmark advertising campaign featuring his name and likeness.</p>

    <h2>Monsters and Aliens</h2>
    <p>I like to draw monsters and aliens in my free time. A notable painting was of a serial killer alien, however, my favorite drawing is of monsters trying to change a lightbulb.</p>

    <h2>Jail Time</h2>
    <p>I once spent a night in jail for mistaken identity. Police arrested me for stealing a VHS tape from Blockbusters. They thought it was me because I'm only 4'10" and I matched the height and looked similar to the person who actually did it. Eventually I was able to corroborate my whereabouts. I had been in a nearby store, CVS, at the time and thankfully the checkout lady remembered me by the conversation we had about the gum choices.</p>
